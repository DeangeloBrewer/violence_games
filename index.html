Detractors however, aruge that video games are harmful and should be strictly regulated to government legislative oversight and restriction</p>

<p>Video game advocates contend that a majority of the research on the topic is deeply flawed and that no causal relationship has been found between video games and social violence. They argue that violent video games may provide a safe outlet for aggressive and angry feelings and may reduce crime.</p>
