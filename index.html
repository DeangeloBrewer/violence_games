<div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-secondary text-white"><p>The controversy around video games revolve around a wide variety of debates and reserch around the social effects of video games on players and society in general.</p>
 <p>Video game advocates have emphasized their use as an expressive medium, arguing for their protection under the laws governing freedom of speech and also as an educational tool. Detractors however, aruge that video games are harmful and should be strictly regulated to government legislative oversight and restriction</p>
 <p>Violent video games have been blamed for school shootings, increases in bullying, and violence towards women. Critics argue that these games desensitize players to violence, reward players for simulating violence, and teach children that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts.</p>
 <p>Video game advocates contend that a majority of the research on the topic is deeply flawed and that no causal relationship has been found between video games and social violence. They argue that violent video games may provide a safe outlet for aggressive and angry feelings and may reduce crime.</p> </div>
